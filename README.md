# TYPE & OPEN SOURCE LECTURE

A lecture that explores open source design for type students.

- Outline here?
- Make a new markdown file? then we each riff?
- I think we should edit the same file script/ideas wise; maybe then make "slides" as individual SVGs from inkscape or something? we can then compile them together at the end based on talking points.
- Focus on slides as visual, graphic accompaniment; not deep informational "slides" â€” more important to feature work and F/LOS tools w/ the slides than to repeat content we'll be literally saying. (show more w/ slides; tell more with script/words?)
